I am interested in Beyond the Standard Model physics, particularly in phenomenological studies of composite Higgs models. During my Phd, my research focused on effective models 
  for BSM physics related to compositeness, including future collider studies and extensions to dark matter models, and my work had a 
  strong focus on computational tools and machine learning applications. My previous research was in experimental high energy physics 
  with the ATLAS project at CERN, and I took a brief detour into medical physics where I investigated optimisation techniques for brachytherapy treatment of cervical 
  cancer.
