I am interested in Beyond the Standard Model physics, particularly in phenomenological studies of composite Higgs models. My work has a 
  strong focus on computational applications and I have begun to venture into machine learning. My previous research was in experimental high energy physics 
  with the ATLAS project at CERN, and I took a brief detour into medical physics where I investigated optimisation techniques for brachytherapy treatment of cervical 
  cancer. In my current PhD research I am exploring BSM physics related to compositeness, including future collider studies and extensions to dark matter models.
